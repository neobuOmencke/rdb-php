## What is BMW SSS Progman v32?
  
BMW SSS Progman v32 is an abbreviation of "Software Service Station with Programming Manager". It is a software system that was used by BMW dealerships to diagnose and program BMW and Mini vehicles from 1987 to 2009. It consists of three main components:
  
- **EDIABAS**: This is the tool set that communicates with the vehicle modules and provides the interface for the other components.
- **DIS**: This is the "Dealer Information System" that provides diagnostic functions such as fault reading, resetting, testing, and creating test plans.
- **Progman**: This is the "Programming Manager" that provides programming functions such as updating software, changing vehicle order, coding modules, and personalizing settings.

BMW SSS Progman v32 works with all BMW "E-Series" models from 1987 to 2009 and all Mini "R-Series" models from 2001 to 2009. However, it requires special BMW supplied connectors and cables to perform these functions. You can use either a serial ADS cable for older models or a USB K+DCAN cable for newer models. You can also use a BMW DK (Yellow Head), OPS, or OPPS interface if you have one.
