## Step 1: Check the model number of your system
 
The first thing you need to do is to check the model number of your system. It should be written on the face of the deck, usually on the bottom right corner. You can also check the manual or the box of your system if you have them. The model number should be something like UCNV884RE, AVN1106D, AVN5505D, etc.
 
## Step 2: Find the compatible boot disc or SD card for your system
 
The next thing you need to do is to find the compatible boot disc or SD card for your system. You can either buy them online from some websites that sell them, such as [cegps](https://cegps9.wixsite.com/cegps/japanese-deck-rebooting)[^1^], or download them from some sources that offer them for free, such as [opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/eclipse-ucnv884re-boot-cd-free-download)[^3^] or [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/tercaeclangu/eclipse-ucnv884re-boot-cd)[^4^]. Make sure you choose the right boot disc or SD card for your model number. For example, if your model number is UCNV884RE, you need to get the ECLIPSE UCNV884RE DVD DOWNLOAD[^1^]. If your model number is AVN5505D, you need to get the Eclipse AVN BOOT DVD DOWNLOAD[^1^]. If your model number is NMCT-W50, you need to get the NMCT-W50 SD CARD DOWNLOAD[^1^]. And so on.
 
## Step 3: Burn the boot disc or copy the files to the SD card
 
The next thing you need to do is to burn the boot disc or copy the files to the SD card. If you are using a boot disc, you need to burn the downloaded file to a blank DVD disc using any ISO burning software. Burn the disc at the lowest speed possible. If you are using an SD card, you need to extract the downloaded file with WinRar or 7zip and copy the folder labelled "PRIVATE" or all the files (depending on the instructions) to an empty SD card. Do not make any new folder on the SD card.
 
## Step 4: Insert the boot disc or SD card into your system and wait for it to load
 
The last thing you need to do is to insert the boot disc or SD card into your system and wait for it to load. If you are using a boot disc, insert it into the slot of the deck that's labelled "Map". In a few seconds it will start loading to restore the functions of the deck, such as radio, DVD, TV, reverse camera, etc. If not, press a button on the deck for the boot disc to start loading. If you are using an SD card, insert it into the map slot at the front of the lid and wait for it to load firmware. After that it will allow you to close the LCD lid of your device. Take out your SD card and close the lid.
 
## Conclusion
 
That's how you can boot up your Eclipse UCNV884RE system with a boot disc or SD card. You may need to do this every time you disconnect the battery or change the car. The boot disc or SD card does not include any map data, only boot files. You may need to update your map data separately if you want to use navigation features.
